## For new Flutter developers

If you're brand new to Flutter, we suggest you complete the following resources in order:

- [Dart language overview](https://dart.dev/overview) Flutter uses the Dart language. If you have experience with other object-oriented languages, like Java, C++, or Swift, Dart should feel familiar to you, and you might be comfortable skipping this section.
- [Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab) This codelab introduces the basics of Flutter by creating an app that works on mobile, desktop, and web.
- [Learn the fundamentals](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/fundamentals) This is an opinionated set of documentation for the new Flutter developer. It guides you through some of the most important pieces of building Flutter applications.
